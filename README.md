# JsonPowerDB-Mini_Project
## Student Enrollment Form

# Description: 

*A student enrollment form is used to register new students to schools, colleges, or universities. With this free online Student 
      Enrollment Form, educational institutions of all sizes can seamlessly collect student enrollment forms online! I have used 
      JSONPowerDB for creating this Enrollment Form. It accepts field such as Roll-NO (as primary key), Full-Name, Birth Date, 
      Address, Class, Enrollment Date.*
      
      1. There will be three control buttons [Save], [Update] and [Reset] at the bottom of the form. On page load or any control 
      button click, an empty form will be displayed and the cursor will remain at the first input field in the form which will have
      the primary key in the relation. All other fields and buttons shouldbe disabled at this time.

      2.User will enter data in the field having primary key and
      
      a) If the primary key value does NOT exist in the database, enable [Save] and [Reset] buttons and move the cursorto the next 
      field and allow the user to enter data in the form.
      
      b)If the primary key value is present in the database, display that data in the form. Enable [Update] and [Reset] buttons and 
      move the cursor to the next' field in the form. Keep the primary key field disabled and allow users to change other form fields.
